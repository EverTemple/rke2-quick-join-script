# rke2-quick-join-script
Quickly update the packages, setup necessary packages, as well as join a server/agent node into a RKE2 cluster.

## Usage
Download to your machine using curl. Update the variables accordingly.

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EverTemple/rke2-quick-join-script/master/join.sh

## Disclaimer
Only tested it on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS. I use it for joining new servers myself.
